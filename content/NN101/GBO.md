### Introduction
##### What is optimization?
Optimization is selecting the best element with some criterion. Optimization problem is maximizing or minimizing functions by choosing inputs.[^1]

> [!Example] Real-life Optimizations Example
> - Optimizing the design to maximize the performance.
> - Optimizing the recommendation algorithm to show best personalized advertisement.
> - Optimizing the factory to spend less time and money.

### Mathematical Optimization
This is just finding $x$ that maximizes or minimizes some function $f(x)$. It is easy for some simple functions, i.e. quadratic functions.
$$
f(x)= ax^2 + bx+c
$$
